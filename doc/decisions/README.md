# About decision documents

Decision documents are brief statements of decision - the decision itself,
and synopses of our thinking and intent. They promote maintainability of software.

They are a history of any significant policy, product, or tech decisions
(though not limited to these subjects).

They are historical records, so:

* There are no "in progress" decision documents that make it to master
* The audience is future collaborators, and/or yourself in ~6 months

Content and style:

* Strive for brevity, even "pithiness".
* Fewer than 20 lines of text (wrapping included) should be the norm.
* Consider following the trends you see regarding content, style, and structure, in recent decision docs.
* Big writing projects should use gdocs. Once finalized, make a decision doc that's a jump-off point to the gdoc - summarize the gdoc, discussion around the doc, and any decisions reached, and then link to the gdoc.
