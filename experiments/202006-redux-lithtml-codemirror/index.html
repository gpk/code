    Redux is a very small FP-ish MVC library

    Imagine all your dispatch+controller code were in a single function that contains a giant switch statement.
      All possible actions (e.g. user keyboard input, "save", "exit", "rename", etc) are
        handled via case statements.
      ...the logic for each of these actions is in each case statement.
    But what is this "logic" doing?
    In Redux, it is simply transforming the Model in some way

      function controller(currentModel, action) {
        switch (action.type) {

          case "rename":
            return {...currentModel, name: action.newName}

          case "clear":
            return {...currentModel, content: ""}

          ...
        }
      }


    You hand this method to Redux, and internally it's taking actions that happen (say as a result
    of something a user does with your app), and calling this big switch method...

      const newModel = controller(model, {type:"rename", newName: "foo2"})

    Current model + action go in, new model comes out. Repeat.



    Nomenclature change: Redux has different terms though. Model = State, Controller = Reducer. Revised example,
      in which your "function controller(..." is now "function myReducer(...":

      const newState = myReducer(state, {type:"rename", newName: "foo2"})

    Immutability: it's pretty important that the incoming state object not be side-affected, at least if you want to
    keep your sanity when debugging stuff.  You can simply use object spread (as above). There's also immer,
    which I like and which the redux folks appear to still recommend https://stackoverflow.com/a/60819732



    The "V" in MVC.

    Redux has something it calls a store, you create it using your reducer function and an initial state:

    const initialState = {name: "foo"}
    const store = Redux.createStore(myReducer, initialState)  // i.e. "controller" and initial "model"

      // think: simplest possible "view rendering function"...but just for debugging purposes
      function nameConsoleRenderer() {
        console.log(`current name: ${store.getState().name}`)
      }

      // think: simplest possible html-based "view rendering function"
      function nameDomRenderer() {
        document.body.innerHTML = `Name: <br>${store.getState().name}</br>`
      }

    Then you add your rendering functions to the store:

      store.subscribe(nameConsoleRenderer)
      store.subscribe(nameDomRenderer)

    ...and every time there's a state update, redux will invoke each view function.
    Your immediate reaction is likely:
      "holy crap does that mean html-re-rendering is happening all the time? That's nuts."
    To which I say:
      - "No - whether to actually have dom-mutating effects on any invocation is up to the view function.
        You can have it hold its own internal state across view invocations (e.g. via a higher-order function that closes
        around some common tracking variables), which you will often do. For example, it's totally unacceptable to
        re-render a code editor as someone is typing in it."
      ...but also
      - "Yes - by default I let things just re-render...and that's because of stuff like lit-html, that uses
        tricks like shadow-DOM to optimize what gets re-rendered, and so there's often very little perf impact."
        (<- this is why redux and lit-html make a pretty good pair)


    The round trip

    The redux store has a dispatch method, which is how actions are dispatched:

    const store = Redux.createStore(myReducer, initialState)
    store.subscribe(nameConsoleRenderer)
    store.subscribe(nameDomRenderer)
    store.dispatch({type: "rename", newName: "foo2"})

    Dispatch will:
      - cause myReducer to be invoked with initialState plus the action {type: "rename", newName: "foo2"}
      - myReducer invokes appropriate "business logic" that produces a new state in which name = "foo2"
      - invoke nameConsoleRenderer. When nameConsoleRenderer invokes store.getState(), the object returned will
          be the new state, i.e. with name = "foo2"
      - invoke nameDomRenderer (same idea)

    Common ways one invokes store.dispatch:
      - in the response callback of an ajax call
      - in a dom event handler,
          e.g. "onclick=function(){store.dispatch({type:"rename", newName:rootElement.querySelector(".nameField").value})}"


    Conclusions:

    Redux is super simple, and it might be hard to see what its value even is.
    It takes what is naively/potentially a totally insane concurrent+mutable-state client-side mess and imposes
    discipline.

    Every single state transition happens via separate,
    serial invocations of a glorified giant switch statement, at the end of each of which, all view effects occur.
    Then the next action takes the resulting state, and repeats the cycle.

    The discipline yields a lightened mental burden. Even the most complex MVC interactions get boiled down to some
    simple testable "parts", and become something you can easily reason through, and thus have some confidence in
    actually consistently working for users.

    The flip side is that if you lapse into old ways of imagining how application state should be handled,
    e.g. by burying it in the dom, you will be harshly punished, and Redux will always win (but you'll end up
    feeling good about that, because the Redux way is better than your bad old way).


    Uncovered: we didn't talk about async behavior, that's for a separate example.

    /*
    Example app:

    The user sees two panes: one is an editor they can type in,
    and another displays some stats about what they typed.

    Goals:
      - Show some rudimentary codemirror/redux/lit-html
      - Show an example that's a little beyond "trivial". It's like a super-stripped-down form of what we're building.

    Non Goals:
      - Demonstration of async behavior
      - Better code design (I have some beefs w/ vanilla Redux patterns - particularly regarding having "application
        code" access store state via closures). Stick to redux default patterns.
