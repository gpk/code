    /*
    I find redux-loop's approach to management of async state to promote testability and good code organization.

    This is in contrast to action creators and thunks:

    from https://bytes.grubhub.com/using-redux-loop-to-make-tacos-at-grubhub-5e67741c9cdc
    > Thunks, however, have their drawbacks. How do you test the action creator that returns a function without
    > running the side effect itself? Furthermore, “pure” Redux logic gets mixed with side effect logic. This
    > causes the functions to be messy and tricky to maintain.

    This is the redux-loop philosophy:
    > Synchronous state transitions caused by returning a new state from the reducer in response to an action are
    > just one of all possible effects an action can have on application state.

    ...so, a case statement in a reducer might just return a new state.
    ...or it might return a new state plus something to do next (like, an async call)

    In production, redux-loop intercedes to process the "extra" stuff that you return (e.g. some async call)

    The example demonstrates how one would typically test an async call - both the request and response.

    It uses SynchronousPromise as a fakey, immediately-executing Promise.
