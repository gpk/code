Experiments:

* Allow you to try out, and demonstrate, small examples and ideas, 
* In a share-able way (within the codebase)
* They allow you and others to see important functionality and dependencies work in isolation

Experiment guidelines:

* Directory names are YYYYMM-experiment-name, 
  where YYYYMM is the year and month the experiment was created
* All dependencies should be localized to the experiment directory
* Please bear in mind that **no large files shall be committed to the git repo**
* Therefore there's a good chance you'll be wanting to .gitignore stuff - please just add to the top=level .gitignore file.
